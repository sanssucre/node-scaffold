# Node project scaffold #

This is my idea of how a node micro service project should be structured

### You can use this as a base project structure when creating a new node based micro service ###

* The scaffold has 2 main directory under source
** app which contains the business logic of you application
** controller which contain all the web related code.
* 1.0.0

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Repo owner or admin
